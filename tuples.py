# A built- in data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values
# tup =(2,1,3,1)
# print(tup[0])
# print(tup[1])
# print(type(tup)) 

# -----tuple slicing
# tup =(1,2,3,4)
# print(tup[1:3])

# Tuple methods------

tup =(2,1,3,1)
print(tup.index(1))#returns index of first occurrence
print(tup.count(1))# counts total occurrences
